    description: 'Understanding what the Quran is and its place in Islam.',
    guidance: `The Quran is the literal word of Allah, revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ over 23 years through Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). It is the final revelation to humanity, completing the message of all previous prophets.

Unlike other holy books, the Quran has been perfectly preserved in its original Arabic since revelation. Millions have memorized it entirely, creating a living chain of preservation.

The Quran is not just a book to read - it's meant to be recited, pondered, and lived. It contains guidance for every aspect of life, from spiritual matters to practical daily living.`,

    description: 'The story of revelation and preservation.',
    guidance: `The first revelation came to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in the Cave of Hira, when he was 40 years old. Angel Jibreel appeared and commanded him to "Read!" (Iqra) - the first word revealed.

The Quran was revealed gradually over 23 years, addressing specific situations and building the Muslim community. Verses were memorized immediately by companions and written on various materials.

After the Prophet's death, the first Caliph Abu Bakr ordered the Quran to be compiled into one book. The third Caliph Uthman standardized the text, which remains unchanged to this day.`,

  {
    id: 63,
    title: 'Day 63: Structure of the Quran',
    description: 'Chapters, verses, and how to navigate.',
    guidance: `The Quran contains 114 chapters called Surahs, and over 6,000 verses called Ayahs (literally "signs").

Surahs vary greatly in length - the longest (Al-Baqarah) has 286 verses, while the shortest (Al-Kawthar) has only 3. They are arranged roughly by length, not chronologically.

Each Surah has a name, often from a key word or theme within it. For example:
• Al-Fatiha (The Opening) - Chapter 1
• Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - Chapter 2
• An-Nas (Mankind) - Chapter 114

When referencing the Quran, we say "Surah [name], Ayah [number]" - for example, "Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayah 255" (the famous Ayatul Kursi).`,

    title: 'Day 64: Meccan vs Medinan Surahs',
    description: 'Two distinct periods of revelation.',
    guidance: `The Quran was revealed in two phases:

MECCAN SURAHS (610-622 CE): Revealed before the migration to Medina
• Focus on faith fundamentals: Tawhid, afterlife, prophethood
• Often shorter with powerful, rhythmic verses
• Address the pagan Meccans
• Establish core beliefs

MEDINAN SURAHS (622-632 CE): Revealed after the migration
• Focus on practical laws: family, finance, governance
• Often longer with detailed rulings
• Address the growing Muslim community
• Build the Islamic society

Understanding this context helps you appreciate why certain verses were revealed.`,

  {
    id: 65,
    title: 'Day 65: The Magnificence of Arabic',
    description: 'Why the Quran was revealed in Arabic.',
    guidance: `Allah chose Arabic for the Quran for profound reasons:

Arabic is incredibly rich - a single word can contain multiple layers of meaning. The Quran's Arabic is so beautiful and eloquent that it challenged the greatest Arab poets, who were renowned for their linguistic mastery.

While translations convey the meaning, they cannot capture the full depth, rhythm, and eloquence of the original Arabic. This is why:
• We recite the Arabic in prayer
• Scholars study the original text
• Learning Arabic unlocks deeper understanding

Don't be discouraged - many great Muslims don't speak Arabic. Translations are valid for understanding, and you can gradually learn Quranic Arabic over time.`,

    guidance: `The Quran addresses many themes, but some appear repeatedly:

1. TAWHID: Allah's oneness and attributes
2. GUIDANCE: How to live a righteous life
3. PROPHETHOOD: Stories of messengers and their missions
4. AFTERLIFE: Paradise, Hell, and the Day of Judgment
5. NATURE: Signs of Allah in creation
6. HISTORY: Lessons from past nations
7. LAW: Rules for worship, transactions, and relationships
8. ETHICS: Character, justice, and compassion

The Quran is not arranged by topic but weaves these themes throughout, often within a single Surah.`,

    id: 67,
    title: 'Day 67: Stories of the Prophets',
    description: 'Learning from those who came before.',
    guidance: `The Quran mentions 25 prophets by name, including many familiar from other traditions:

• Adam - The first human and prophet
• Nuh (Noah) - Saved from the flood
• Ibrahim (Abraham) - Father of monotheism
• Musa (Moses) - Freed the Israelites
• Isa (Jesus) - Born miraculously to Maryam
• Muhammad ﷺ - The final messenger

These stories aren't just history - they're lessons. Each prophet faced trials: rejection, persecution, doubt from their people. Yet they persevered with faith.

Some prophets mentioned only in the Quran include Hud, Salih, and Shu'ayb - sent to ancient Arabian peoples.`,

    description: 'Understanding the prayer you recite most.',
    guidance: `Al-Fatiha is the most recited chapter - you say it in every rakah of prayer. Let's understand it deeply:

"All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds" - Establishing who Allah is
"The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful" - His mercy encompasses all
"Master of the Day of Judgment" - He alone judges
"You alone we worship, You alone we ask for help" - The essence of Islam
"Guide us to the straight path" - Our core request
"The path of those You have blessed, not those who earned anger or went astray" - Asking to follow the righteous

This Surah is a conversation with Allah. A hadith says Allah responds to each verse when you recite it.`,

    description: 'A surah equal to one-third of the Quran.',
    guidance: `Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112) encapsulates the essence of Islamic monotheism:

"Say: He is Allah, the One" - Absolute oneness
"Allah, the Eternal Refuge" - All depend on Him, He depends on none
"He neither begets nor is born" - No family, no origin
"Nor is there to Him any equivalent" - Nothing compares to Him

The Prophet ﷺ said this Surah equals one-third of the Quran because it fully explains who Allah is - the foundation of faith.

It's short enough to memorize quickly, and reciting it in prayer is especially virtuous.`,

    guidance: `Ayatul Kursi (Al-Baqarah 2:255) is called the greatest verse:

"Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great."

SURAH AL-FALAQ (113):
"Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak, from the evil of that which He created, from the evil of darkness when it settles, from the evil of those who blow on knots, from the evil of an envier when he envies."

SURAH AN-NAS (114):
"Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, the Sovereign of mankind, the God of mankind, from the evil of the whisperer who withdraws, who whispers in the breasts of mankind, from among the jinn and mankind."

    guidance: `To help with regular reading, the Quran is divided into:

30 JUZ (Parts): Equal portions allowing you to complete the Quran in a month by reading one juz daily. This is especially common during Ramadan.

60 HIZB (Sections): Each juz is divided into two hizb, allowing for 60-day completion.

7 MANZIL (Stages): Seven portions for weekly completion.

Many Muslims aim to:
• Complete the Quran in Ramadan (30 days)
• Read at least one page daily
• Listen during commutes or work

Start small - even one verse daily is better than nothing. Consistency matters more than quantity.`,

    guidance: `Tajweed means "to make beautiful" - it's the set of rules for reciting the Quran correctly.

Key aspects include:
• Makharij: Proper articulation points for each letter
• Sifaat: Characteristics of letters (heavy, light, etc.)
• Rules of Noon and Meem: When to merge, hide, or emphasize
• Madd: Elongation of vowels
• Stops: Where to pause for meaning

Learning Tajweed takes time. Start by:
1. Listening to master reciters
2. Taking a basic Tajweed course
3. Reading with a teacher who can correct you
4. Practicing regularly

Perfect Tajweed isn't required for prayer validity - effort and sincerity matter most.`,

• Historical context of revelation (Asbab an-Nuzul)
• Arabic linguistic meanings
• Related verses elsewhere in the Quran
• Prophetic explanations (Hadith)
• Opinions of the Companions

    guidance: `Allah calls the story of Yusuf (Joseph) "the best of stories" (Ahsan al-Qasas). Surah Yusuf (Chapter 12) tells it completely:

Young Yusuf has a prophetic dream. His jealous brothers throw him in a well and sell him to slavery. He ends up in Egypt, where a minister's wife tries to seduce him. He resists but is imprisoned for years.

In prison, he interprets dreams correctly. Eventually, he interprets the king's dream and is freed, becoming Egypt's minister. During famine, his brothers come to Egypt not recognizing him. He tests them, then reveals himself and forgives them. The family reunites.

LESSONS: Patience in hardship, resisting temptation, forgiveness, trusting Allah's plan.`,

    title: 'Day 77: The Story of Musa',
    description: 'The prophet mentioned most in the Quran.',
    guidance: `Musa (Moses) is mentioned by name more than any other prophet - over 130 times. His story spans multiple Surahs:

Born during Pharaoh's persecution of Israelites, baby Musa is placed in a basket and floats to Pharaoh's palace. He grows up as a prince but kills an Egyptian and flees.

In Midian, he works for Shu'ayb, marries, and then encounters Allah at the burning bush. He returns to challenge Pharaoh with his brother Harun, showing signs and miracles.

After the plagues, Pharaoh lets the Israelites go, then chases them. Allah parts the Red Sea. In the desert, Musa receives the Torah and leads his people through trials.

LESSONS: Standing against tyranny, trust in Allah, patience with community.`,

    description: 'The father of prophets and monotheism.',
    guidance: `Ibrahim (Abraham) is called "Khalilullah" - the friend of Allah. His story teaches pure monotheism:

Young Ibrahim rejects his father's idol-making business. He debates his people, smashing their idols and challenging their logic. They throw him in a fire, but Allah makes it cool and safe.

He migrates for Allah's sake, settles his wife Hajar and son Ismail in the barren desert of Mecca. Allah provides the spring of Zamzam. Ibrahim is commanded to sacrifice Ismail - both submit to Allah's will, and a ram is substituted.

Ibrahim and Ismail build the Kaaba, the first house of worship for Allah, which Muslims face in prayer today.

LESSONS: Questioning blindly following tradition, complete trust in Allah, sacrifice.`,

    title: 'Day 79: Isa in the Quran',
    description: 'Understanding Jesus in Islam.',
    guidance: `Isa (Jesus) is a beloved prophet in Islam. The Quran clarifies:

BIRTH: Maryam (Mary) was the most righteous woman. She conceived Isa miraculously, without a father - like Adam was created without parents. This was a miracle, not divinity.

MISSION: Isa was sent to the Children of Israel with miracles - healing the sick, raising the dead by Allah's permission. He confirmed the Torah and brought the Injeel (Gospel).

NOT CRUCIFIED: The Quran states Isa was not killed or crucified, but Allah raised him up. Someone else was made to resemble him.

NOT GOD: Isa is honored as a prophet and messiah, but not divine. He never claimed to be God.

RETURN: Muslims believe Isa will return before the Day of Judgment.`,

    title: 'Day 80: Women in the Quran',
    description: 'Celebrating the women mentioned in Allah\'s book.',
    guidance: `The Quran honors several women as role models:

MARYAM (Mary): The only woman mentioned by name in the Quran. An entire Surah (19) is named after her. She is called the best of women.

ASIYA: Wife of Pharaoh who believed despite her tyrant husband. She is one of the four perfect women.

KHADIJAH: The Prophet's first wife (mentioned in hadith). She was the first believer.

WIFE OF IBRAHIM: Sarah, who received the news of a son in old age.

QUEEN OF SHEBA: A powerful ruler who recognized Prophet Sulayman's message.

MOTHER OF MUSA: Whose faith led her to place her baby in a basket in the Nile.

The Quran establishes women's spiritual equality with men and provides them with rights revolutionary for the time.`,

    title: 'Day 81: Parables in the Quran',
    description: 'Allah\'s analogies that illuminate truth.',
    guidance: `Allah uses parables (Amthal) to make abstract concepts understandable:

THE LIGHT VERSE (24:35):
"Allah is the Light of the heavens and earth. His light is like a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp in glass, the glass like a brilliant star..."

THE SPIDER'S WEB (29:41):
Those who take protectors besides Allah are like the spider who builds a fragile house.

THE GOOD TREE (14:24-25):
A good word is like a good tree with firm roots and branches in the sky, bearing fruit continuously.

THE BAD TREE (14:26):
A bad word is like a bad tree uprooted, with no stability.

DEAD EARTH BROUGHT TO LIFE (22:5):
The earth appears dead, then Allah sends rain and it flourishes - a sign of resurrection.

These parables make the spiritual tangible.`,

    description: 'Knowledge revealed 1400 years ago.',
    guidance: `The Quran contains statements that align with modern science, revealed centuries before discovery:

EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT (23:12-14):
Describes stages from drop to clinging clot to flesh to bones - matching modern embryology.

EXPANSION OF UNIVERSE (51:47):
"And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are its expander."

BARRIER BETWEEN SEAS (55:19-20):
Fresh and salt water meet but don't mix - oceanographers confirmed invisible barriers.

MOUNTAINS AS PEGS (78:6-7):
Mountains have deep roots stabilizing the earth - like tent pegs.

FINGERTIPS (75:4):
Allah mentions reassembling fingertips - we now know fingerprints are unique.

These aren't the primary purpose of the Quran (which is guidance), but they're signs for those who reflect.`,

SIGNS BEFORE: The sun rises from the West, the Beast appears, Isa returns, Gog and Magog emerge.

THE TRUMPET: An angel blows the trumpet. All creation dies. Then another blast resurrects all.

THE GATHERING: All humans from Adam to the last person stand before Allah. The sun is brought near.

THE RECKONING: Books of deeds are opened. Some receive books in their right hand (success), others in their left or behind (failure).

THE SCALES: Deeds are weighed. A sincere "La ilaha illallah" can outweigh mountains of sins.

THE BRIDGE (Sirat): All must cross a bridge over Hell. It's thin as a hair, sharp as a sword. Some cross like lightning, some crawl.

THE INTERCESSION: Prophets and the righteous intercede for others.`,

DESCRIPTIONS:
• Fire fueled by people and stones
• Burning skin replaced to burn again
• Boiling water and Zaqqum (bitter tree)
• Chains and darkness
• Size: It will ask, "Are there any more?"

THE GATE KEEPERS: Angels ask, "Did no warner come to you?" They reply, "Yes, but we denied."

HOPE: Even those in Hell may eventually be removed if they had the smallest faith. Allah's mercy is vast.

TYPES OF HEARTS IN THE QURAN:
• Sound Heart (Qalb Saleem): Pure, devoted to Allah
• Diseased Heart: Harboring doubt, hypocrisy, or attachment to sin
• Hardened Heart: Deaf to guidance, like stone or harder
• Sealed Heart: Completely blocked from truth

THE QURAN'S EFFECT:
"The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith." (8:2)

Regular Quran recitation:
• Softens the heart
• Removes spiritual diseases
• Increases faith
• Brings peace and tranquility

    description: 'From reading to implementation.',
    guidance: `The Companions didn't just read the Quran - they lived it. They wouldn't move to new verses until implementing what they learned.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENTATION:
1. READ with understanding - use a translation
2. REFLECT on the meaning - how does it apply to you?
3. IDENTIFY action items - what is Allah asking of you?
4. IMPLEMENT gradually - start with one thing
5. TEACH others - share what you learn

EXAMPLES:
• Read about charity → Give something today
• Read about patience → Practice in next difficulty
• Read about prayer → Improve your khushu (focus)
• Read about parents → Call them, be kind

The Quran judges for or against us on Judgment Day. Make it a witness in your favor.`,

Keep reading, keep learning, keep reflecting. The Quran will be your companion through every stage of life.`,
