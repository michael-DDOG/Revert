    title: 'Day 91: Islam as a Complete Way of Life',
    description: 'Understanding that Islam guides all aspects of living.',
    guidance: `Islam is not just a religion practiced on certain days or in certain places - it's a complete way of life (Deen).

From the moment you wake until you sleep, Islam provides guidance:
• How to eat and drink
• How to conduct business
• How to treat family and neighbors
• How to handle emotions
• How to dress and groom
• How to speak and interact

This isn't restrictive - it's liberating. Instead of guessing what's right, you have divine guidance. Instead of following changing trends, you have eternal principles.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "Islam began as something strange and will return to being strange, so blessed are the strangers."`,
    reflection: 'What area of your daily life would you most like Islamic guidance on?',

    id: 94,
    title: 'Day 94: Islamic Dress Code',

  {
    id: 95,
    title: 'Day 95: Relationships Between Men and Women',
    description: 'Appropriate interaction guidelines.',
    guidance: `Islam provides guidelines to protect relationships:

GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
• Lower your gaze (don't stare)
• Avoid unnecessary physical contact
• Meet in public or with others present

THE CONCEPT OF MAHRAM:
Men and women who CAN'T marry (close relatives) have more relaxed rules:
• Parents, grandparents
• Siblings
• Children, grandchildren
• Aunts, uncles
• In-laws (some)

NON-MAHRAM:
Those who could potentially marry should maintain boundaries.

THE WISDOM:
These aren't outdated restrictions but protections for:
• Marriages (preventing infidelity)
• Families (protecting honor)
• Society (preventing exploitation)
• Individuals (protecting from heartbreak)

This applies gradually - take steps without overwhelming yourself.`,
    reflection: 'What relationship boundaries might you need to establish or strengthen?',

  {
    id: 96,
    title: 'Day 96: Marriage in Islam',

REQUIREMENTS FOR MARRIAGE:
• Consent of both parties
• Mahr (gift from groom to bride)
• Two witnesses
• Public announcement (walimah feast)
• Wali (guardian) for the bride (most schools)

CHOOSING A SPOUSE:

Husband's rights: Loyalty, respect, care of home and children

FORBIDDEN MATCHES:
• Already married (up to 4 wives allowed with strict conditions)
• Close blood relatives

  {
    id: 97,
    title: 'Day 97: Family Relations',
    description: 'Rights of parents, children, and relatives.',
    guidance: `Family is the foundation of Muslim society:

RIGHTS OF PARENTS:

• Speak gently, never say "uff"
• Provide for them in old age

    id: 98,
    title: 'Day 98: Neighbors and Community',
    description: 'Rights of those around you.',

RIGHTS OF NEIGHBORS:
• Don't harm them
• Protect their property
• Help in times of need
• Share food with them
• Visit when sick
• Don't spy on them
• Lower your gaze from their homes

WHO IS YOUR NEIGHBOR?
Classical scholars said 40 houses in each direction. Modern context: those who live near you, work with you, go to school with you.

THE BEST MUSLIM:
"The best companion with Allah is the one who is best to his companions, and the best neighbor is the one who is best to his neighbors."

NON-MUSLIM NEIGHBORS:
Same rights apply. Islam doesn't restrict kindness based on faith.`,
    reflection: 'How well do you know your neighbors? What could you do for them?',
  },
  {
    id: 99,
    title: 'Day 99: Business and Work Ethics',

• Quality workmanship
• No deception or fraud

PROHIBITED BUSINESS:

• Fraud and deception
• Exploitation

EARNING HALAL:
"O you who believe, eat from the good things We have provided for you." (2:172)

The Prophet ﷺ said: "Seeking halal is an obligation after other obligations."

Even your daily work becomes worship when done with the right intention and ethics.`,

    description: 'Celebrating your incredible journey.',
    guidance: `100 days! SubhanAllah - you've shown tremendous commitment.

REFLECT ON YOUR JOURNEY:
• From first learning about Islam to now
• The prayers you've established
• The knowledge you've gained
• The changes you've made
• The challenges you've overcome

WHAT THE PROPHET ﷺ SAID:
"The most beloved deeds to Allah are those done consistently, even if small."

You've been consistent for 100 days. That consistency is more valuable than occasional bursts of enthusiasm.

YOUR TRANSFORMATION:
You're not the same person who started. You've grown in:
• Knowledge of Allah
• Understanding of Islam
• Personal discipline
• Spiritual awareness
• Connection to the ummah

Take a moment today to thank Allah for guiding you to this path.`,

  {
    id: 101,
    title: 'Day 101: Dealing with Interest (Riba)',
    description: 'Navigating finances in a modern world.',
    guidance: `Interest (riba) is strictly prohibited:

"Allah has permitted trade and forbidden interest." (2:275)

WHY PROHIBITED:
• Creates wealth without work
• Exploits those in need
• Causes economic inequality
• Leads to debt slavery

MODERN CHALLENGES:
• Bank accounts with interest
• Mortgages
• Student loans
• Credit cards
• Business loans

SOLUTIONS:
• Islamic banks (no interest, profit-sharing instead)
• Halal mortgages (Murabaha, Musharakah)
• Interest-free credit cards exist
• Negotiate interest-free payment plans

IF ALREADY IN INTEREST-BASED DEBT:
Scholars advise:
1. Don't take new interest-based loans
2. Pay off existing debt ASAP
3. Give any interest earned to charity (not as reward, but disposal)
4. Make tawbah and transition to halal

This is one of the hardest areas - seek specific guidance from scholars.`,

"Every good deed is charity." - Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

CONTINUOUS CHARITY (Sadaqah Jariyah):

These continue earning reward after death.

ETIQUETTE:
• Give secretly when possible (left hand doesn't know what right gives)
• Don't follow with reminder of your generosity
• Give the best, not the worst
• Don't delay when you can give now`,

    guidance: `Islam teaches comprehensive manners (Adab):

GREETING:

• The one who greets first is better

EATING AND DRINKING:
• Say "Bismillah" before
• Eat with right hand
• Eat from what's nearest you
• Don't criticize food
• Say "Alhamdulillah" after

SNEEZING:
• Cover your mouth
• Say "Alhamdulillah"
• Others say "Yarhamukallah"
• You reply "Yahdikumullah"

ENTERING HOMES:
• Seek permission three times
• Enter with right foot saying dua
• Announce yourself

SITTING:
• Don't point feet at Quran or elders
• Make room for others
• Don't take someone's spot

    title: 'Day 104: Controlling the Tongue',
    description: 'The power and danger of speech.',
    guidance: `The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak good or remain silent."

SINS OF THE TONGUE:
• Lying
• Backbiting (gheebah): Saying true but negative things about someone absent
• Slander (buhtan): Saying false things
• Gossip
• Mockery
• Cursing
• Arguing
• Bragging

BACKBITING DEFINED:
"Mentioning your brother in a way he would dislike." If it's true, it's backbiting. If false, it's slander.

EXCEPTIONS:
Allowed to mention faults when seeking help, warning others of harm, or seeking justice.

THE TONGUE'S WEIGHT:
One word can:
• Enter you into Paradise
• Throw you into Hell
• Heal a heart
• Break a heart
• Start a war
• Bring peace

Guard your tongue like a treasure.`,

  },
  {
    id: 105,
    title: 'Day 105: Anger Management',
    description: 'Islamic guidance for controlling emotions.',
    guidance: `The Prophet ﷺ said: "The strong person is not the one who can wrestle, but the one who controls himself when angry."

WHEN ANGRY:
• Say "A'udhu billahi min ash-shaytanir-rajim"
• Change position (if standing, sit; if sitting, lie down)
• Make wudu (water cools anger)
• Stay silent
• Leave the situation if needed
• Remember Allah's reward for restraint

THE DANGER OF ANGER:
• Words you can't take back
• Damaged relationships
• Regrettable actions
• Health problems
• Harms the soul

RIGHTEOUS ANGER:
Being angry for Allah's sake (against injustice, sin) is different from personal anger. Even then, act wisely.

THOSE WHO RESTRAIN ANGER:
"Those who spend in prosperity and adversity, who restrain anger and pardon people - Allah loves the doers of good." (3:134)`,
    reflection: 'What triggers your anger most? How can you respond differently?',
  },
  {
    id: 106,
    title: 'Day 106: Patience (Sabr)',
    description: 'The essential quality of believers.',
    guidance: `"Indeed, Allah is with the patient." (2:153)

THREE TYPES OF SABR:

1. PATIENCE IN OBEDIENCE:
Continuing to pray, fast, be good when it's hard

2. PATIENCE IN AVOIDING SIN:
Restraining yourself when tempted

3. PATIENCE IN HARDSHIP:
Enduring tests and trials without complaining

REWARDS OF PATIENCE:
• Allah's company
• Full reward without measure
• Paradise
• High rank

EXPRESSING FEELINGS:
Patience doesn't mean suppressing emotions. Prophet Yaqub cried until blind over Yusuf. But he didn't complain to people - he complained to Allah.

"I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah." (12:86)

Cry to Allah, not to people. Trust His plan.

WHAT SABR IS NOT:
• Passive acceptance of injustice
• Allowing abuse
• Giving up effort`,
    reflection: 'What are you patiently enduring right now? How can you improve your sabr?',
  },
  {
    id: 107,
    title: 'Day 107: Gratitude (Shukr)',
    description: 'Appreciating Allah\'s countless blessings.',
    guidance: `"If you are grateful, I will surely increase you." (14:7)

FORMS OF GRATITUDE:
1. With the heart: Recognizing blessings come from Allah
2. With the tongue: Saying Alhamdulillah
3. With actions: Using blessings in obedience

GRATITUDE VS INGRATITUDE:
Grateful people: See blessings in everything
Ungrateful people: Only see what they lack

The Prophet ﷺ advised: "Look at those below you (in worldly matters), not those above you, so you don't belittle Allah's blessings."

BLESSINGS WE OVERLOOK:
• Sight, hearing, mobility
• Health
• Safety
• Family
• Food and water
• Faith itself

GRATITUDE PRACTICE:
Start and end each day naming specific blessings. The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever wakes up safe in his home, healthy in body, with food for the day, it's as if he has the whole world."`,
    reflection: 'List 10 blessings you might take for granted.',
  },
  {
    id: 108,
    title: 'Day 108: Humility vs Pride',
    description: 'The antidote to the first sin.',
    guidance: `Pride (Kibr) was Iblis's (Satan's) sin - refusing to bow to Adam.

THE PROPHET ﷺ SAID:
"No one with an atom's weight of pride in his heart will enter Paradise."

WHAT IS PRIDE:
• Rejecting truth when presented
• Looking down on others
• Thinking you're better
• Seeking glory for yourself

SIGNS OF PRIDE:
• Can't accept criticism
• Always need to be right
• Boast about achievements
• Treat certain people as inferior
• Struggle to apologize

HUMILITY (Tawadu):
• Acknowledging all good comes from Allah
• Treating everyone with respect
• Listening to advice
• Admitting mistakes
• Serving others

THE BALANCED WAY:
Humility isn't weakness or low self-esteem. It's recognizing your place before Allah while maintaining dignity.

"The servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth in humility." (25:63)`,
    reflection: 'In what situations might pride affect you?',
  },
  {
    id: 109,
    title: 'Day 109: Envy and Contentment',
    description: 'Finding peace with what Allah decreed.',
    guidance: `"Do not wish for what Allah has bestowed on some of you over others." (4:32)

ENVY (Hasad):
Wishing someone would lose their blessing - a destructive disease.

"Beware of envy, for it consumes good deeds like fire consumes wood."

PERMISSIBLE DESIRE (Ghibtah):
Wishing to have what someone has without wanting them to lose it. This is allowed.

CAUSES OF ENVY:
• Comparing yourself to others
• Forgetting your own blessings
• Not trusting Allah's wisdom
• Social media feeds

CURING ENVY:
• When envy arises, seek refuge in Allah
• Make dua FOR the person you envy
• Remember blessings you have
• Trust Allah's distribution is wise
• Focus on the Hereafter

CONTENTMENT (Qana'ah):
"True richness is richness of the soul."

The Prophet ﷺ had little worldly wealth but was the most content person.`,
    reflection: "Is there someone you've envied? How can you shift that feeling?",
  },
  {
    id: 110,
    title: 'Day 110: Forgiveness',
    description: 'Letting go of resentment.',
    guidance: `"Let them pardon and overlook. Would you not like that Allah should forgive you?" (24:22)

WHY FORGIVE:
• Allah forgives those who forgive
• Holding grudges hurts you
• It frees your heart
• The Prophet ﷺ forgave even his worst enemies

LEVELS OF RESPONSE TO WRONG:
1. JUSTICE (Qisas): Take equivalent retribution (your right)
2. FORGIVENESS ('Afw): Let go without compensation
3. EXCELLENCE (Ihsan): Forgive AND respond with good

Forgiveness is higher, but justice is also valid when needed.

WHAT FORGIVENESS ISN'T:
• Accepting abuse to continue
• Pretending it didn't happen
• Trusting again immediately
• Putting yourself in harm

You can forgive someone but still maintain boundaries for your safety.

FORGIVING YOURSELF:
If Allah, the Most Just, forgives when you repent, who are you to hold against yourself what He has forgiven?`,
    reflection: "Is there someone you need to forgive? What's holding you back?",
  },
  {
    id: 111,
    title: 'Day 111: Entertainment and Leisure',
    description: 'Having fun the halal way.',
    guidance: `Islam doesn't prohibit enjoyment - it channels it:

PERMISSIBLE ENTERTAINMENT:
• Sports and physical activities
• Spending time with family
• Nature and travel
• Beneficial knowledge
• Islamic poetry and nasheeds
• Gatherings with good company
• Hobbies that develop skills
• Games without gambling

PROBLEMATIC ENTERTAINMENT:
• Music with haram content
• Movies/shows promoting sin
• Gambling (even "friendly" bets)
• Mixed gatherings with inappropriate behavior
• Time-wasting with no benefit
• Anything leading to haram

THE MUSIC DEBATE:
Scholars differ. Most prohibit or restrict instruments while permitting vocals. At minimum, avoid lyrics promoting sin.

THE BALANCE:
"Give your soul its right" - even the Prophet ﷺ joked, raced with Aisha, and enjoyed simple pleasures. But entertainment shouldn't distract from obligations or lead to sin.`,
    reflection: 'How can you make your leisure time more aligned with Islam?',

    id: 112,
    title: 'Day 112: Social Media and Internet',
    description: 'Navigating the digital world as a Muslim.',
    guidance: `The internet is a tool - like a knife that can cook food or cause harm:

    title: 'Day 113: Maintaining Old Friendships',
    description: 'Navigating relationships with non-Muslim friends.',
    guidance: `Becoming Muslim doesn't mean abandoning everyone from your past:

MAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS:
• Family ties are obligatory (especially parents)
• Old friendships can continue with boundaries
• Be kind and just to everyone
• Avoid situations that compromise your faith

THE QURAN SAYS:
"Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion... from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them." (60:8)

CHALLENGES YOU MAY FACE:
• Pressure to drink at gatherings
• Mockery of your new beliefs
• Not understanding your changes
• Feeling like you don't fit in

STRATEGIES:
• Explain your changes with kindness
• Offer alternatives (meet for coffee instead of bar)
• Find new Muslim friends too
• Be patient - people take time to adjust
• Your good character is dawah

Some friendships may naturally fade, others will strengthen. That's okay.`,

• Convert/revert support groups

QUALITIES TO LOOK FOR:

• Encourage you to good
• Patient with your learning
• Not judgmental of your past

AVOID FRIENDS WHO:
• Mock your practice
• Encourage sin

• Don't walk in front of those praying
• Turn phone off or silent
• Speak softly

• Leave with left foot, saying dua

FRIDAY (JUM'AH):
• Obligatory for men
• Shower, dress well, apply fragrance
• Arrive early
• Listen to khutbah (sermon)
• Two rakah fard prayer

FINDING A MOSQUE:
Different mosques may have different cultures:
• Some primarily one ethnicity
• Some more convert-friendly
• Some have more programs

Visit several to find your fit. Don't be discouraged by unwelcoming experiences - keep searching.`,

COMMON QUESTIONS:
• "Why would you choose that?"
• "What about women's rights?"
• "Isn't Islam violent?"
• "Do you have to wear that?"
• "What about your family?"

RESPONDING:
1. Stay calm - anger doesn't help
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Speak from your experience
4. Admit when you don't know
5. Invite them to learn with you
6. Make dua for them

YOU DON'T NEED ALL ANSWERS:
It's okay to say "That's a great question. I'm still learning. Let me get back to you."

KNOW YOUR WHY:
When you know deeply why you accepted Islam, challenges don't shake you. Your experience with Allah is your strongest proof.

WHEN TO WALK AWAY:
Not every argument deserves engagement. If someone is mocking, not genuine, save your energy.

COMMON REACTIONS:

STRATEGIES:
• Be patient - they need time
• Show Islam through your improved character
• Don't force discussions
• Maintain ties regardless
• Involve them in your life (meals, events)
• Answer questions honestly
• Invite them to learn

WHAT THE QURAN SAYS:
"But if they strive to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. But accompany them in this world with kindness." (31:15)

DON'T OBEY IN SIN:
If they ask you to leave Islam, don't. But still treat them with kindness, respect, and maintain family ties.
